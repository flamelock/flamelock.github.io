	<p>There are a few graphical glitches however, if your right click the game and enter full screen they seem to fix themselves.</p>
	<p>Note from developers:</p>
	<p>This is NOT Super Meat Boy!</p>
	<p>Its simply the flash prototype that Super Meat Boy was based off of. <br>
		SMB, will play very differently and is 100% new.. what im saying is if you even slightly enjoy the prototype, you will LOVE SMB!</p>
	<p>for more info on Super Meat Boy check out <a href="https://supermeatboy.com" style="color: #8ebf42" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">supermeatboy.com (not HTTPS so beware, I recommend just visiting their Steam page.)</a></p>
